# Federated Learning Algorithms Implementations (FedAvg, FedBn) using Python
This repository contains implementations of Federated Learning algorithms, specifically Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Batch Normalization (FedBN), using Python. Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach that allows training models across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples without exchanging them.
Datasets Used:
CIFAR-10: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes
MNIST: A dataset of 42,000 handwritten digit images
